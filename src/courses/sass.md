This course is a deep dive into the world of Sass, as well as advanced CSS.

Starting at the *very* basics of Sass, slowly but surely we add new tools to our repitoire and deep dive to make sure we understand how the Sass/SCSS that we are writing is compiled into CSS the browser can understand. 

This isn't just about learning how Sass works, but we create real projects along the way as well.
