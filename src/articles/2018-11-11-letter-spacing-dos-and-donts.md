title: The Do's and Don'ts of letter-spacing
description: Proper use of letter-spacing can improve readability and also just increase the aesthetic of your site, whereas bad use of it can make things unreadable. In this post, I explore the Do's and Don'ts of letter-spacing to help you improve the readiblity and look of your text.

Another week, another article about something design related! If you missed the past few, I strongly suggest checking them out, as these little things can make a big impact on your overall design. And, have you noticed that theyâ€™re all typography related?

**People donâ€™t give typography enough credit!** Iâ€™ll save the rest of that rant for another day though. For the time being, letâ€™s look into what you should, and shouldnâ€™t, use `letter-spacing` for on the web.

## Why `letter-spacing` matters

Before I get into some tips and tricks though, I want to just do a quick mention on why you should care about `letter-spacing` to begin with. 

- It affects readablity (helps it if done right, hurts it if done wrong)
- Can help give your type a more refined look

Readability should come before anything else. We have text on our pages, so any decisions weâ€™re making with `letter-spacing` should be about making our text as easy to read as possible.

That has the added benefit of making things just *look nicer* while youâ€™re at it. Adding in the little details to your designs is what takes something from just okay to looking really sharp, and nice uses of `letter-spacing` can really help with that.

## `letter-spacing` doâ€™s and donâ€™ts

### DO: Add** `letter-spacing` to uppercase text

If your text is all uppercase, itâ€™s harder to read (the first thing here is, you shouldnâ€™t put a lot of text in all caps, but if itâ€™s short titles, you can get away with it). 

**One way to help make it easier to read** is to add a bit of `letter-spacing`. Aim for just a touch, just to space things out a little bit. 

![Example showing uppercase text with no letter-spacing, and with letter-spacing](/img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing-example-01.png)

Youâ€™ll notice in the above example that itâ€™s barely noticable. Thatâ€™s sort of the point! We arenâ€™t doing it for creative reasons, or trying to make an impact, weâ€™re just making a subtle change. It gives each character just a little bit more room, and helps boost readability a touch.

### DONâ€™T: Add too much `letter-spacing`

While adding just a touch can make uppercase text easier to read, adding too much makes it harder to read, so watch out for that. Most of the time, the goal is to make text easier to read, so always keep that in mind when playing around with your values.

![Example showing uppercase text with no letter-spacing, moderate letter-spacing, and a lot of letter-spacing](/img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing-example-02.png)

Maybe you like how the above example looks with the massive `letter-spacing`. It definitely gives it a unique look. You might have seen some really nice uses of really big `letter-spacing` out and about in the world as well, but most of the time itâ€™s in very specific situations. It gives it a unique look, but it also makes it a lot harder to read!

So yes, it might be used in a creative way to look nice, or to purposefully slow the reader down, but be very aware that it can very much impact the readability of the text, so try not to go too crazy. Use it in a logo for the slogan or something, donâ€™t use it on a run of words that you actually want people to read.

### DO: Increase** `letter-spacing` for small text

When text drops to smaller sizes ([under 16px on the web](https://accessibleweb.com/wcag_2_0_developers/minimum-font-size/), in general), it gets harder to read. Depending on the font, a small amount of `letter-spacing` can help. Again, donâ€™t push it too far though! At smaller font sizes, itâ€™s possible the characters appear a little crowded though, and this can help make things a touch easier to read.

![Example of small text with no letters-spacing and with some letters-spacing](/img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing-example-03.png)

This could be for things like captions on images, bylines, and other places where a smaller `font-size` makes sense. Just add a little touch though, donâ€™t go nuts!

### DONâ€™T: Play with the `letter-spacing` of your body text

If the font you picked for you body looks a little too cramped and you feel that adding a little bit of `letter-spacing` would help make it more readable, my guess is youâ€™ve picked a display font for your body. 

Fonts are designed for specific purposes (good fonts at least), and have been optimized to be used at specific sizes. If you look at fonts designed for the print world, some super families go beyond the whole *light*, *medium*, *bold*, *black*, scale. Theyâ€™ll have those (and many more) for captions, and then a new set for body, and another set for display. Captions are for small sizes, body for body text, and display for bigger sizes like our headings. Head on over to [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/) (formally Typekit) and in your search options, you can pick between Display and Paragraph. 

![Example of paragraph text with normal, loose, an tight letter-spacing](/img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing-example-05.png)

In the above example, the top one has no `letter-spacing`, whereas the second has `letter-spacing: 1px` and the bottom one `letter-spacing: -1px`. Itâ€™s not a giant change, but I think itâ€™s obvious which is easiest to read.

If you pick a font thatâ€™s optimized for body text (your paragraphs), then you shouldnâ€™t have to play with itâ€™s `letter-spacing`. Itâ€™s possible you could do a little extra work and make it better, but my guess is the professional who designed the font did a pretty good job of that already.

### DO: Always add `letter-spacing` to small uppercase text

You might feel like Iâ€™m cheating with this one because Iâ€™m just combining my previous two tips into one. Maybe I am, but itâ€™s worth noting that you really should do this.

![Example of small text with normal and loose letter-spacing](/img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing-example-04.png)

Small text is harder to read. Uppercase text is harder to read. Give people a chance, and space out those letters! I might also want to note here that maybe itâ€™s not the best idea to use uppercase text for small text, but sometimes we do things for design purposesâ€”it can look really nice when used in moderationâ€”so if you *just have to do it*, then at least add that `letter-spacing` to it. Bonus: the extra spacing can give it a nicer aesthetic as well.

### DONâ€™T: Recude `letter-spacing` without a good reason

Tightening up the `letter-spacing` on something will make it harder to read. There are times that you can do it, for example [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudalpartners.com/) does it to nice effect on their headings (and notice the loose letter-spacing on their uppercase, small text right on top of the heading). 

Iâ€™d limit it to larger text though, and once again, on things which are short. Donâ€™t squeeze a full paragraph together just for the fun of it (see the example with the paragraphs above for proof). 

Some fonts tend to work better when setting them with tight `letter-spacing`, and if youâ€™d like a few tips on how to pick ones that work well, [this article from Hoefler & Co.](https://www.typography.com/blog/fonts-for-tight-tracking) is great.

## Recap

Here is the tl;dr for all of you who were skim reading till the end ðŸ™‚ 

### Good things to do

- add `letter-spacing` to all uppercase text
- sometimes `letter-spacing` can be useful when the `font-size` gets small (less than 16px)
- And `letter-spacing` is really important if that small text is uppercase

### Things you shouldnâ€™t do

- Add too much `letter-spacing`.
- Add or reduce `letter-spacing` to your body. Itâ€™s possible the font hasnâ€™t been optimized, but chances are that itâ€™s perfectly fine.
- Reduce `letter-spacing` without a good reason (and if you do, pick a font that it works well with)
